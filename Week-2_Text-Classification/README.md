# Week 2 – Text Classification Model

**Task Description**

The objective of this task was to build a text classification model using Natural Language Processing techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

**Dataset**

SMS Spam Collection Dataset containing labeled SMS messages.
Dataset: SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

**Approach**

 1. Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal)
 2. Text vectorization using Bag of Words.
 3. Training a classification model.
 4. Evaluating model performance.

**Technologies Used**

 1. Python
 2. Pandas
 3. Scikit-learn
 4. NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit)

**How to Run**

 1. Open `WeIntern_Task_2.ipynb` from the `code` folder.
 2. Run all cells sequentially.
 3. View accuracy and prediction outputs.

**Learnings**

 1. Understood NLP preprocessing steps
 2. Learned how text is converted into numerical features
 3. Built and evaluated a text classification model
